databases project for school


This project will connect to a MySQL server running on localhost, with:

To open the solution for this project, navigate to RealBeast > RealBeast.csproj and double click. It will open up in Visual Studio.

To create an instance of the database on your computer, open Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console, and run `Update-Database`.

From there, you can experiment with the data. There is next to no functionality yet but the groundwork is just about done!
